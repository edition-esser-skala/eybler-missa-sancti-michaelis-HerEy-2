  – & –    & –      & \B1 and \B2 are generally inconsistent regarding
                      dynamics, phrasing, and articulations, which necessitated
                      a comparably large number of (tacit) emendations.
                      Minor differences between \B1 and \B2 and within the
                      sources (org, vlne, and vlc) have been tacitly aligned.
                      In the vocal parts of both sources, the division between
                      solo and tutti parts is somewhat ambiguous. This edition
                      strives for a meaningful division. \\
